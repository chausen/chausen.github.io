Forgot to taste the coffee black. Adding it a bit of cream, I wasn't super impressed:
- smooth
- bit of bitterness
- low acidity
- earthy
- weak flavor profile
- reminds me of a diner coffee, but better

- Water: 505mL
- Grind: Medium-fine
- Time: 2m 55s
```
This time, I drank it black first and preferred it that way. The flavor came through more and there was some complexity to it.

## Black
- smooth mouth feel
- complex flavor notes; I can maybe see the flavors on the bag

## With Cream
- adds some richness
- cuts the strong flavors

# Brew 3
```
- Method: cappuccino
- Beans: 18g
- Milk: 128g
```
- I enjoyed this one as a cappuccino
- Flavor came through nicely
- Still a bit of an earthy taste that I'm not sure I'm the biggest fan of

# Final thoughts
Overall, a solid bean, but not my favorite. In looking online to find out the elevation and varietal, I saw the same producer makes a Gesha that Huckleberry does an annual special release for. I would like to try that one.
