# Initial Thoughts
Many people move from home to go to college. Many people move for a job. Others move just because, and that's where I find myself. Often in the former cases, the destination is set. It's less important than the reason for going. When you are moving just because, and almost nowhere is out of the question, the options can become overwhelming.

I know I've been here for way too long, so where do I go next? What criteria can help me choose? Well, one of my reasons for wanting to leave Florida is that it's way too hot. So, weather is good a criteria. I want to be close to natural beauty. I want to be somewhere with people my age. Somewhere with enough people for there to be plenty to do, but not so many that it's overcrowded. I'd like to have similarities with these people so I can make friends. These criteria alone narrow it down.

# I Already Moved
I wrote the thoughts above several weeks ago when I was staying in North Carolina temporarily while trying to figure this out. I didn't finish my thoughts, and that's not surprising given how difficult it felt to approach this decision using reason. Or at least, reason could only get me so far. I tried collecting all kinds of quantifiable information: average temperatures, population, cost of living, etc. Ultimately, something more serendipitous led to my current residence in Denver, CO. It came down to:
1. I've never lived in a major city (outside of a several months living in Atlanta for an intership)
2. I don't necessarily want to spend the rest of my life in a major city, but I want to try it, and I may as well do that now
3. Denver seems like a cool place

It's funny because it goes against my initial criteria of "not overcrowded" (though Denver doesn't seem too bad considering what's said about the traffic), but I had to just let go and use my intuition a bit to make a decision. In the end, the metrics didn't matter much--there were so many good options, and none of the places I was considering I had spent a significant amount of time at. So, I kind of just picked something. And so far, it's panning out, because Denver seems like a cool place.
