# First day drinking
Drinking as a cappuccino, I don't taste the complex fruity notes listed on the bag. It's a delicious, balanced cup--very smooth. But the flavor notes are quite subtle and if anything I would describe them as being nutty or chocolatey.

# Second day drinking
Drinking as a cappuccino again. I tasted slightly fruity notes this time, but overall it was mostly smooth and chocolatey.

# Third day drinking - Virtuous Brew
I brewed using the virtuous method today--pour over. First, I tried it black:
- Stronger fruit notes
    - I could definitely taste the blood orange
- The 'complexity' came through stronger
- Crisp and tart
Next, added a little cream:
- Still taste fruity notes, though they are bit muted
- Cuts the tartness/crispness and adds a bit of smoothness

# Final thoughts
Overall, a solid bean. I recently have been more into strong, complex fruit flavors that punch through the richness of a cappuccino (usually, I like a smooth, rich breakfast style). I felt this one felt a bit short in that regard. The pour over was solid, but again, nothing special.

6.5/10 beans
